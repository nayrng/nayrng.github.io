Hi! My name is Ryan Ng.

I am currently an aspiring software engineer, and have a huge interest in programming and computer science.

Aside from computer science, I enjoy hiking, running, and watching football.

Thanks for stopping by my website, and feel free to look around and get in touch with me!
