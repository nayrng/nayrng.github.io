title: About me
---

I am a rising senior at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and I am expected to graduate in June 2020. I am an excellent programmer who is proficient at data structures and algorithms, critical thinking, and team-work. 

From my time working at Alameda County writing Government standard code to update thousands of usersâ€™ computers, I know how to write clean and thoroughly tested code. I also gained significant technical experience from working on several personal projects; two involving intensive data queries through the NFL database, another collaborating with my fellow students on a comprehensive website and the other creating an Android app from scratch that has to handle lots of data synchronization, among other things. I am also an Eagle Scout, and have extensive leadership experience as a Boy Scouts camp leader. In addition to being a fast learner and great communicator, I take constructive criticism very well and am always open to learning new things.
