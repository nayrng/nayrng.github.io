A website where users can sign up for haircut appointments with a barber of their choosing. Users can register as a barber or a customer. Once an appointment has been made, other users can't sign up for the same timeslot with the same barber, avoiding conflicting appointments. Both the customer and barber are then sent an email confirmation of the appointment.

Made in collaboration with Brix Joshua Tanhueco.
